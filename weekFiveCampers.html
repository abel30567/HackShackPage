                        use TNT to demolish lands and rebuild new structures with his creativity. Not only did he design in three dimensions, but he also used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create his own logo & his very own t-shirt!

Max created a Magic Tower and a Pikachu design using the TinkerCAD 3D design software. Max is very independent and a quick learner. He teamed up with Shai 
                        to create Minecraft worlds and created a Minecraft Museum and he displayed luxurious armor. Max also used Adobe Illustrator & Adobe Photoshop to create his own logo and his t-shirt.

                        Matthew keeps on working on his designing skills because he has a knack for it, specially in 3D models.

                    <h5>Daniel had a blast at camp this week. He was constantly designing his own robots and was very playful with the other campers. Daniel used TinkerCAD to create his own double sided table.
                        Daniel really loves robotics and you can see that from his shirt design, he used Adobe Photoshop to create his shirt. Daniel is one of our most curious campers and is not afraid to take on any challenge!
